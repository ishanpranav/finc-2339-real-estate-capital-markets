## Short Question 1

> Property mogul Ronald Prumt considers buying a multi-family property at a cap
> rate of 6 percent. Consider the simplified user cost model and
> assume that the after-tax mortgage rate at which Prumt can finance the
> purchase is 6 percent per year and the maintenance expenditure is 2 percent
> per year. What is the minimum expected future price appreciation such that
> this would be a winning deal for Prumt?

For a given period $t$, let $R_t$ denote rental income and $P_t$ denote price.
Note $R/P=6\%$. Let $r(1-\tau)=6\%$ denote the mortgage rate after applying tax
rate $\tau$ and $m=2\%$ denote the maintenance rate.

The simplified user cost model gives the expected price appreciation.

$$\frac{R_0}{P_0}=r(1-\tau)+m-\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_0}-1\right).$$

$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_0}-1\right)&=r(1-\tau)+m-\frac{R_0}{P_0},\\
&=6\%+2\%-6\%,\\
&=2\%.
\end{align*}$$

Intuitively, since rental income covers the mortgage interest expense, the
minimum expected price appreciation is 2 percent (to cover the maintenance
expense).

## Short Question 2

> Your good friend Jennifer is very optimistic about the housing market and
> believes that house prices can only go up. As a consequence, she wants to buy
> the most expensive home she can possibly afford, with the idea of selling it
> at a profit in a few years. She has $4,000 per month that she can spend on the
> mortgage payment (and her parents offered to help out with the down payment).
> Jenniferâ€™s lender has offered her three types of mortgages: a standard 30 year
> FRM, a 5/1 ARM with standard amortization, and a 5/1 ARM with a 5-year
> interest-only period. Jennifer asks you for help.

### Short Question 2 Part A

> For simplicity, ignore taxes and tax deductions for this question.

> Which mortgage type do you think is best given her objective?

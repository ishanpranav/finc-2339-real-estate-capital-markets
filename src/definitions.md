__Cash flow.__

Let $r$ be the discount rate and $n$ be the number of periods.

Given an asset $X$, let ${V_X}_j$ be its value in period $j$, where
$0\leq j\leq n$, and ${C_X}_j$ be its cash flow in period $j$.

Define $\text{pv}:\mathbb{Q}^4\to\mathbb{Q}$, which yields ${V_0}_j$ given $r$,
$n$, ${C_X}_j$, and ${V_X}_n$.

Define $\text{pmt}:\mathbb{Q}^4\to\mathbb{Q}$, which yields ${C_X}_j$ given $r$,
$n$, ${V_X}_0$, and ${V_X}_n$.

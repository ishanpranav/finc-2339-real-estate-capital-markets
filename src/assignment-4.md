## Short Question 1

> Holding all else equal, what would you expect to happen to the AAA

> fewer loans in the deal? Why? How is this related to differences in credit
> ratings for single asset or single buyer (SASB) versus conduit
> commercial-mortgage-backed security (CMBS) deals?

*Caeteris paribus*, suppose that there are fewer loans, rather than more loans,
in a nonagency MBS deal.

> Why might the value of commercial real estate (CRE) or CMBS be falling?

CMBS values are falling because the underlying commercial real estate is
falling, specifically in the retail sector. Eric Yip, chief investment officer
of Alder Hill Management and the author of the original thesis, claimed that
e-commerce would eliminate brick-and-mortar shopping.

The expansion of e-commerce and subsequent collapse of anchor retailers like
Toys 'R' Us and Sears meant that malls were oversized compared to their sales,
especially in second-tier markets. Yip argued that mall debt was a "toxic
cocktail," since the risky mortgages were backed by properties that were "highly
likely to become ‘dead malls.’" If that happened, tenants would not be able to
pay, landlords would default, and lenders would find their collateral impaired.

Around 2017, Eric Yip (and other investors, including his former employer Carl
Icahn of Icahn Enterprises) undertook aggressive short positions on commercial
real estate debt via credit default swaps (CDS) on the CMBX commercial mortgage
indices. These insurance products allow investors to take bearish positions on
retail commercial real estate.

Unfortunately for Yin, the CMBS values did not decline as quickly as
anticipated. In fact, in the short term, they rose: Two mutual funds propped up
the price by disclosing their large long position and accepting the other side
of Yin's CDS trade.

As a result, funds that invested in CRE and CMBS did not experience the steep
losses that Yip and the short investors anticipated. In the end, the shorts cut
their losses, costing Yip his hedge fund. Had they held until 2020, they might
have seen major gains instead.

**Conclusion:** CRE and CMBS markets can be manipulated by large investors and
their reputations. It's difficult to take an extreme position, even when you are
correct, since there are too many confounding factors.
